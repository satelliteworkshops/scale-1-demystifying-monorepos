# Demystifying monorepos

> When it comes to migrating large projects to Git, many companies struggle with how to deal with their existing projects. Should repositories remain as ‚Äúmonorepos‚Äù or should they be broken up? Steffen Hiller is helping teams answer questions just like these and manage their monorepos for better performance and easy collaboration. In this session, find out how big is too big when it comes to monorepos ‚Äî and get hands-on experience to start improving your repository size and performance.
